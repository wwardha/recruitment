## System Architecture

### Architecture Pattern: Microservices

The system follows a microservices architecture with Docker containerization, providing:
- Independent, scalable services for each business domain
- Service isolation and fault tolerance
- Technology flexibility per service
- Easy horizontal scaling
- Docker-based deployment and orchestration

### Microservices Breakdown

1. **Frontend Service**: React + Tailwind CSS application
2. **API Gateway**: Central entry point, handles routing and authentication
3. **Auth Service**: User authentication and JWT token management
4. **User Service**: User profiles and role management
5. **Job Service**: Job requisitions and postings
6. **Application Service**: Candidate applications and resume management
7. **Notification Service**: Email and notification handling

Each service runs in its own Docker container with dedicated database schemas.

### API Design: Hybrid REST + GraphQL

- **REST API**: Standard CRUD operations
  - `POST /api/jobs` - Create job posting
  - `GET /api/candidates/:id` - Fetch candidate details
  - `PUT /api/applications/:id/status` - Update application status

- **GraphQL**: Complex data queries for dashboards
  - Single `/graphql` endpoint
  - Optimized for React frontend data needs
  - Reduces network round-trips

### Technology Stack

#### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18+
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Data Fetching**: TanStack Query (React Query)
- **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod validation
- **Routing**: React Router v6
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library

#### Backend
- **Runtime**: Bun.js (high-performance JavaScript runtime)
- **Framework**: Elysia.js (Bun-native web framework)
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM (TypeScript-first, type-safe)
- **Authentication**: Lucia Auth (session-based)
- **API Documentation**: Elysia Swagger plugin
- **Background Jobs**: BullMQ with Redis
- **Testing**: Bun's built-in test runner

#### Infrastructure
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+ (separate schema per service)
- **Cache**: Redis (shared across services)
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 / Cloudflare R2
- **Email Service**: SendGrid / AWS SES
- **Container Orchestration**: Docker & Docker Compose
- **Service Discovery**: Docker internal networking
- **API Gateway**: Custom Bun.js gateway service
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with Docker builds
- **Development**: Docker Compose with hot reloading

### Security Architecture

- **Authentication**: JWT-based with refresh tokens
- **Authorization**: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Data Encryption**: TLS/HTTPS for transport, pgcrypto for sensitive data at rest
- **Input Validation**: Zod schemas for all API endpoints
- **CORS**: Strict origin policies
- **Dependency Security**: Regular audits with `bun audit`

### Integration Points
